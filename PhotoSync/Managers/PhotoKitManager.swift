        /*
         The PhotoKit API is very very fast - updating the Photo objects in core data is the bottleneck here.
         So I've written the Photo.update call to take lists of assets, because the predicate "where ID IN (?)"
         is much faster than calling "where ID == ?" for each element in the array. So this loop will fetch
         blocks of 200 photos at once from PhotoKit. It's considerably faster than updating a single image
         at a time, and this loop is the tine critical part of the iCloud photo sync.

         I also periodically save and flush the context. Do this too often and you're spending all your
         time writing to disk. Do little and the unsaved changes in the context build up and slow the process
         down.

         The step size and the flush batch size are chosen here based on my device (iPhone 11) saving about 50k
         photos from my local library, where I get about 15k photos per second written into the data store.
